( I did not have enough time to write an actual legal policy, so here's a shortened version )
Simplified Privacy Policy:
 - During creation of an 'Offer', the user is required to provide their name, their contact details (phone number/email/other), the location of their 'Offer',
   and the type of the 'Offer'.
 - They can also choose to provide their Personal details, such as Age, Gender, Full name & a picture of them. However, this is NOT required.

This information is stored in our database. The information is stored securely and according to the latest security practices.
Every information that you might provide to us via the means of creating an 'Offer' is made public.
You agree to this Policy when creating an offer.


If you wish to permanently delete the information you have provided, you can either:
    - Delete your 'Offer' by using the password provided by you when you created your 'Offer'. (https://uatranshelp.com/delete)
    - Contact us via email: technical@uatranshelp.com
