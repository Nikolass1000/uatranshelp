This is an open source project intended to help and provide information and resources to the refugees of ukraine.
It provides functionality for volunteers to willing-fully create 'Offers' regarding support and help for refugees.

The project's main incentive is to provide the following:
    - Evacuation routes & transport from Ukraine to the Polish or Romanian border(s).
    - Transport within the EU borders.
    - Accommodations within the EU.

The 'Offers' you can find on this website are created by volunteers. It is then important to realise that, anyone can be a volunteer.
Do you have a working vehicle? Do you have a spare room? Are you willing to help? Create an offer.

Note that since anyone can create an offer, this project can not guarantee safety of anyone who shall accept one, therefore
we do not take ANY liability for any damage or harm to anyone or anything who shall accept an offer via the means of this project.
